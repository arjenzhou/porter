## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have apprehensions regarding Porter's security or you discover vulnerability or potential threat, donâ€™t hesitate
to get in touch with the owner by dropping a mail at zhouyang.zy@outlook.com. In the email, specify the description of
the issue or potential threat. You are also urged to recommend the way to reproduce and replicate the issue. I will get
back to you after assessing and analysing the findings.

PLEASE PAY ATTENTION to report the security issue on the security email before disclosing it on public domain.

An overview of the vulnerability handling process is:

* The reporter reports the vulnerability privately to owner.
* The owner works privately with the reporter to resolve the vulnerability.
